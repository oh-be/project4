## ML Libraries Used
* Scikit-learn
## ML Technologies Used
* One Hot Encoder
* Label Encoder
* pd.get_dummies
* TensorFlow Keras Model
* Logistic Regression
## Other Libraries Used
* Python Pandas
* Python Matplotlib
## Deployment Method
* Heroku - have an interactive website that takes into account various factors and then outputs whether or not that property is a good investment right now

## Datasets Used (subject to change)
* Home Value Dataset - Smoothed, seasonally adjusted measure of the typical home value and market changes across a given region for Single-Family Residences; Monthly from 2000 to now
* Target variable - Good investment Right Now (Yes or No)
* Train Data - Housing info from 2000-2021
* Test Data - Predict Housing Price in 2022 

* Zillow Home Value Forecast (All homes, mid-tier cut of ZHVI smoothed and seasonally adjusted)

* Cook County Price Index Data:
